    "### Efficient Resource Utilization: In a multi-core processor environment, multithreading can make better use of CPU resources. By dividing tasks among multiple threads, a program can take advantage of available cores, potentially improving overall performance.\n",

    "### Faster Execution: Certain tasks, such as I/O-bound operations, can benefit from multithreading. While one thread is waiting for I/O (e.g., reading from a file or making a network request), another thread can execute, reducing idle time and improving overall execution speed."
